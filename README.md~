A simple Android app that I created during my time at treehouse

What does it do?

It's a basic messaging app.

You can send images + videos but not text (yet)

Login in Signup and test it out.

Should work on Android HoneyComb and up.

If your new to Android you can go ahead and see how I did things there like the network stuff, sending images, handling users, the login, logout code, handling of images, videos etc and whatever! Enjoy! :)

oh and it's unifinished so you might find some bugs.
